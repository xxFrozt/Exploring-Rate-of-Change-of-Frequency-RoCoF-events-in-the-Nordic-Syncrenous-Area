  - [Short Description](This repository contains code to analyze and process frequency data from FinGrid. Where the main goal is to identify Rate of Change of Frequency events in the Nordic Syncreneous Area. This is a part of my Master Thesis work at NMBU.)
  - [Long Description](The code is written by me but with assistance from co-pilot in VSCode. Using co-pilot have made it possible to quickly identify and fix problems that. There are added comments in the code to make readability and use easier. The different scripts are divided into the folders analysis and plotting. Where the analysis folder contains code that analyses and processes frequency data to retrieve RoCoF events. The plotting folder contains different scripts that create figures to enable showcasing the findings done in the analysis.)
