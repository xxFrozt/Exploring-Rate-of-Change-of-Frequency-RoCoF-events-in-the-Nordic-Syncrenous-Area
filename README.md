## Exploring-Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency-RoCoF-events-in-the-Nordic-Syncrenous-Area

Welcome to this GitHub repository! 
This project is an integral part of my Master's Thesis at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) and focuses on analyzing and processing frequency data from FinGrid to identify Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) events in the Nordic Synchronous Area.
Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

    Analysis: This folder contains scripts that analyze and process frequency data to detect RoCoF events. The code is well-commented to enhance readability and usability.

    Plotting: The scripts in this folder generate visualizations that help illustrate the findings from the analysis phase.

Tools and Techniques

The analysis employs the Whittaker-Henderson smoother, a method of smoothing adapted from Java code originally discussed in the paper "Why and How Savitzkyâ€“Golay Filters Should Be Replaced." For further reading and technical details, see the paper at, https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.1c00054.
Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide a detailed examination of RoCoF events, aiding in the understanding and management of frequency stability within the Nordic Synchronous Area. The repository is designed to be user-friendly, facilitating contributions and use by other researchers or individuals interested in this area of study.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, and use the findings in your own research or applications!
