## Exploring-Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency-RoCoF-events-in-the-Nordic-Syncrenous-Area

Welcome to this GitHub repository! 
This project is an integral part of my Master's Thesis at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) and focuses on analyzing and processing frequency data from FinGrid to identify Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) events in the Nordic Synchronous Area. The code have been used to analyse data from FinGrid in the time from 2015-2023. Which has an unzipped size of about 83 GB.

### The repository is organized into two main folders:

Analysis: This folder contains scripts that analyze and process frequency data to detect RoCoF events. The code is somewhat commented on to enhance readability.

Plotting: The scripts in this folder generate visualizations that help illustrate the findings.

### Tools and Techniques

The analysis employs the Whittaker-Henderson smoother. Which was first introduced by Edmund Taylor Whittaker in 1922. The smoothing method used in this work is adapted to Python from Java code initially introduced by Michael Schmid, David Rath, and Ulrike Diebold in the paper "Why and How Savitzkyâ€“Golay Filters Should Be Replaced." For further reading and technical details, see their paper at, https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.1c00054.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide a detailed examination of RoCoF events, aiding exploring the frequency stability within the Nordic Synchronous Area.

The code is by no means free from faults. The code is published under the MIT Licence, so feel free to explore the code and use it in your own research or application.
